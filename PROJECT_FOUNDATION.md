# LinguaNet Project Foundation
## Decentralized Language Data Marketplace for Global AI
### ETHAccra Hackathon 2025 Submission

### Executive Summary
LinguaNet is a decentralized language data marketplace built for the ETHAccra Hackathon 2025 that transforms smartphones into AI data factories. It enables users worldwide to record audio in underrepresented languages (e.g., Twi, Swahili, Yoruba, Quechua) and earn instant USDC rewards withdrawable to mobile money (MTN, M-Pesa). The platform addresses the critical gap in the $20B+ AI training data market where 90% of models are trained on English despite 7,000+ global languages existing.

### Hackathon Alignment

  - Ethereum for Everyone (Scaling Infra + Real-World UX) - $1,000 total
  - DeFi & ReFi (Sustainable Finance for Africa) - $1,000 total
  - Culture (NFTs & Onchain Creativity) - $1,000 total
- **Bounties Targeted**: 
  - ENS Everywhere ($4,800 - Identity & reputation via ENS subdomains)
  - Ethereum Follow Protocol ($1,000 - Reputation systems for validators)
  - Buidl Guidl ($1,000 - Built with Scaffold-ETH 2)
  - Base ($3,000 - Onchain app with Base Account & Base Pay)
  - Filecoin ($500 - SynapseSDK for sovereign data layer)
- **Total Prize Potential**: $10,300
- **Impact Goal**: Empower 1M+ contributors, preserve 1,000+ languages, democratize AI development

## Problem Statement

### Global Context
- **AI Language Gap**: 90% of AI models trained on English (Stanford HAI)
- **Endangered Languages**: 2,000+ African languages at risk (UNESCO)
- **Market Size**: $20B+ AI training data market underserving non-English languages
- **Economic Exclusion**: Billions of people unable to monetize their linguistic knowledge
- **Cultural Loss**: Indigenous languages disappearing without digital preservation

### Specific Pain Points
1. AI companies lack diverse language datasets for inclusive model development
2. Native speakers have no accessible way to monetize their linguistic expertise
3. High transaction costs and technical barriers prevent participation
4. Centralized platforms extract value without fairly compensating contributors
5. No quality assurance mechanisms for authentic language data

## Solution Architecture

### Value Proposition
LinguaNet creates a three-sided marketplace:
1. **Contributors**: Record audio, earn $3-5 USDC per clip, withdraw to mobile money
2. **Validators**: Verify audio quality, earn $0.50 per validation
3. **AI Companies**: Purchase verified datasets via API for model training

### Key Features
- Mobile-first design for accessibility (1GB RAM Android support)
- Instant USDC payments with mobile money withdrawal
- AI-powered quality checks (TensorFlow.js)
- Human validation for premium datasets
- Decentralized storage (Filecoin)
- Reputation system (EFP profiles)
- ENS identity (subdomain.linguanet.eth)

## Quality Assurance Framework

### Three-Layer Validation System

#### Layer 1: Automated AI Checks (Instant)
- **Clarity Score**: Signal-to-noise ratio >20 dB
- **Language Detection**: Wav2Vec2 model confirms language match
- **Duration Validation**: Minimum 30 seconds
- **Duplicate Detection**: Hash comparison prevents resubmissions
- **Output**: Quality score 0-100 (>80 auto-approved for free tier)

#### Layer 2: Human Validation (Premium Tier)
- **Validators**: Native speakers with verified EFP profiles
- **Process**: 3 validators review each clip
- **Consensus**: 2/3 approval required
- **Feedback**: Specific improvement suggestions for rejections
- **Compensation**: $0.50 per validated clip

#### Layer 3: Community Attestations (Long-term)
- **EFP Reputation**: Track submission history (e.g., "95% approval rate")
- **Peer Reviews**: Community members attest to expertise
- **Trust Scores**: Visible to buyers for quality assurance

## Payment Economics

### Revenue Flow

#### Before Dataset Purchase (Platform-Funded)
```
Treasury (Pre-funded) → Contributors ($3-5/clip)
                     → Validators ($0.50/clip)
```

#### After Dataset Purchase
```
AI Company ($3,000) → Platform (10% = $300)
                    → Treasury Replenishment (90% = $2,700)
```

### Economic Model
- **Contributor Earnings**: $50-200/month (10-40 clips)
- **Validator Earnings**: $100-500/month (200-1,000 validations)
