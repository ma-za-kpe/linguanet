**Re: AI Technical Fellow In-Residence Application**

Dear Emily and the MEST Africa Team,

I am excited to apply for the AI Technical Fellow In-Residence position for the 2026 MEST AI Startup Program. As a MEST alumnus (EIT 2023-2024) and current Technical Co-founder of LinguaDAO, I bring both deep technical expertise and firsthand understanding of the MEST entrepreneurial journey that would be invaluable to the next cohort of entrepreneurs-in-training.

## Why I'm the Right Fit

**MEST Alumni Advantage:** Having completed the MEST program myself, I intimately understand the challenges EITs face when translating technical concepts into viable MVPs. This lived experience, combined with my technical background, positions me uniquely to bridge the gap between curriculum and practical implementation.

**Real-World AI/Blockchain Experience:** I'm currently building LinguaDAO, the first decentralized language preservation protocol, which involves:
- Developing RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines for AI farm advisory systems at Agriguard
- Building smart contracts and DeFi protocols on Base L2
- Creating multi-modal AI systems for voice processing and language analysis
- Implementing MLOps pipelines for production AI deployment

**Technical Leadership Track Record:** With 5+ years of full-stack development experience, I've led technical teams and mentored developers at companies like Accenture, Farmerline Group, and multiple startups across Africa.

## Technical Expertise Alignment

**Core AI/ML Skills:**
- **Python & APIs:** 5+ years building production systems with Django, FastAPI, and Node.js
- **LLMs & RAG:** Currently implementing RAG pipelines for agricultural advisory systems
- **Vector Databases:** Working with embeddings for language preservation data
- **MLOps:** Experienced with Docker, CI/CD, and cloud deployment (AWS, Base L2)
- **Multi-agent Systems:** Building decentralized systems with smart contract interactions

**Teaching & Mentorship Experience:**
- Mentored junior developers at Agriguard and Farmerline Group
- Led technical workshops during my MEST EIT year
- Currently guiding blockchain development for LinguaDAO team

## What I Bring to MEST

**Hands-On "Doer" Mentality:** I thrive in fast-paced environments where I can roll up my sleeves and solve problems alongside entrepreneurs. My experience spans from debugging production issues to architecting scalable systems.

**Cross-Cultural Sensitivity:** Having worked across Uganda, Kenya, Ghana, and Rwanda, I understand the diverse backgrounds of African entrepreneurs and can adapt my teaching style accordingly.

**Innovation Mindset:** LinguaDAO represents exactly the kind of innovative thinking MEST cultivates - using AI and blockchain to solve uniquely African challenges while creating economic opportunities.

**Responsible AI Advocacy:** Through LinguaDAO's focus on cultural preservation and community empowerment, I'm deeply committed to ethical AI development and bias mitigation.

## My Commitment

I'm prepared to dedicate myself fully to this role from January to December 2026, providing:

1. **Interactive Technical Training:** Delivering workshops on Python, APIs, LLMs, RAG, Docker, and CI/CD based on real-world projects
2. **1:1 Coaching:** Drawing from my MEST experience to provide targeted support where EITs need it most
3. **Code Reviews:** Ensuring best practices while helping entrepreneurs build production-ready MVPs
4. **Continuous Learning:** Experimenting with cutting-edge AI tools and sharing insights rapidly with the cohort

## Looking Forward

Having benefited immensely from the MEST program myself, I'm passionate about paying it forward and ensuring the next generation of African entrepreneurs has the technical foundation to build world-class AI products. I'm excited about the opportunity to work alongside the exceptional MEST team I know and respect.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my unique combination of MEST alumni experience, technical expertise, and entrepreneurial journey can contribute to the success of the 2026 AI Startup Program.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
